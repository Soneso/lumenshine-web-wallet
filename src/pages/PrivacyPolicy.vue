        <h2 class="pt-4">THIRD-PARTY LINKS</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including, but not limited to, any third party websites, services, and applications (“Third Party Services”) that you access through the Service, or to individuals that we do not manage, control, or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.</p>

        <h2 class="pt-4">WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>
        <p>In connection with certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect, and display some of your Personal Data. Personal Data is any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (i.e., anonymous data). We collect the following types of information from our users.</p>

        <h2 class="pt-4">PERSONAL DATA</h2>
        <p>You can browse the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Data. If you do not provide Personal Data when requested, we may not be able to provide you with your requested Services.</p>

        <p>When you use the Services, you may choose to register for an account and provide Personal Data, such as your name and email address (“Identity Data”). You acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and you allow others, including us, to identify you and therefore your information may not be anonymous.</p>

        <p>If you opt in to be eligible to win an award or receive a payment for any giveaway, contest, or task, we are required to collect additional Personal Data from you, such as your name, address, government identification number, and date and place of birth (“Identity Data”), in order to establish, confirm or authenticate your identity and to fulfill our legal responsibilities related to Know Your Customer (“KYC”) requirements.</p>

        <h2 class="pt-4">TRANSACTIONS ON STELLAR</h2>
        <p>You may submit transactions, data, and other information to the Stellar network using our Services. All information submitted to the Stellar network is accessible by the public and is stored by distributed and potentially anonymous parties across the globe. We do not retain any control over any transaction data that you submit using our Services to the Stellar network. You acknowledge that all information that you submit to the Stellar network may be stored by third parties indefinitely.</p>

        <h2 class="pt-4">IP ADDRESS INFORMATION AND OTHER INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY</h2>
        <p>We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Services, including your IP address and cookie information (“Technical Data”). This information is used for fighting security attacks, spam, and malware, and also to facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with the Services (e.g., what links you have clicked on).</p>

        <p>Generally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such as which websites, links, and applications visitors were referred from, the number and frequency of visitors to the Site and to each page, and the geography of the visitors. We may use this data in aggregate form as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve our Services.</p>

        <p>We may collect some device and browser specific information if you access the Services using a mobile device and/or web browser. Device information may include, but is not limited to, unique device identifiers, the device’s operating system, mobile carrier and network information, hardware model, location or GPS/geo-location, and how the device interacts with our Services. Browser information may include the type and version of your browser. We use this data in an aggregate form, and not in a way that could identify you personally.</p>

        <h2 class="pt-4">EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS</h2>
        <p>We may receive a receipt and read confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation may include the time which you opened the email, the browser you used, the IP address, the email service provider, other trackers, and the device used. We use this info to improve our customer service and to send our users more relevant emails.</p>

        <h2 class="pt-4">INFORMATION COLLECTED USING COOKIES</h2>
        <p>Cookies are pieces of data that may be provided to your computer through your web browser when you access a website. Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each website you visit. We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit the Site and otherwise use the Services through the Internet.</p>

        <p>Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Data, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Data to tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services.</p>

        <p>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they enable you to take advantage the most attractive features of the Services.</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. We do not control when or how Third Party Services place cookies on your computer. For example, Third Party Services to which a link points may set cookies on your computer.</p>

        <h2 class="pt-4">INFORMATION RELATED TO ADVERTISING AND THE USE OF WEB BEACONS</h2>
        <p>To support and enhance the Services, we may serve advertisements, and also allow third parties advertisements, through the Services. These advertisements are sometimes targeted and served to particular users and may come from third party companies called “ad networks.” Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms.</p>

        <p>Advertisements served through the Services may be targeted to users who fit a certain general profile category and may be based on anonymized information inferred from information provided to us by a user, including Personal Data (e.g., gender or age), may be based on the Services usage patterns of particular users, or may be based on your activity on Third Party Services. We do not provide Personal Data to any ad networks for use outside of the Services.</p>

        <p>To increase the effectiveness of ad delivery, we may deliver a file (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network to you through the Services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized and aggregated auditing, research, and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.</p>

        <h2 class="pt-4">AGGREGATE DATA</h2>
        <p>We collect statistical information about how users, collectively, use the Services (“Aggregate Data”). Some of this information is derived from Personal Data. This statistical information is not Personal Data and cannot be tied back to you or directly or indirectly reveal your identity.</p>

        <h2 class="pt-4">INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR SOCIAL NETWORKS</h2>
        <p>Occasionally, you can use our Services to interact with your accounts on other services, such as Facebook or Twitter. In addition to using your third party account credentials to sign in to the Services, you can access posting and sharing tools on the Services, including a “share” button that allows you to post information to your social networks outside of the Services (“Share”). For example, after making a transaction on the Services, you can Share information about that transaction with your Facebook friends or Twitter followers. Please note that these tools may be operated by Third Party Services.</p>

        <p>By using these tools, you acknowledge that some Third Party Services account information may be transmitted into the Services, and that Third Party Services account information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy. Additionally, when you use one of these sharing tools, the Third Party Service that operates the tool may be collecting information about your browser or online activity through its own tracking technologies and subject to its own privacy policy. Lastly, when you use these tools, some of your information from the Services (such as the transaction information you selected to Share) may be shared with the Third Party Service and others. Therefore, we encourage you to read the privacy policies and other policies of the social networks you use in connection with the Services.</p>

        <h2 class="pt-4">SPECIAL CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL DATA</h2>
        <p>We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data about you (this include details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data).

        <p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), your Personal Data may be transferred outside the EEA. Our offices are in the United States and your data is stored there. Many of our external third parties are based outside the EEA, so their processing of your Personal Data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA. Whenever we transfer your Personal Data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring that your data is given the same protection it has in the EEA.</p>

        <h2 class="pt-4">IS INFORMATION ABOUT ME SECURE?</h2>
        <p>We seek to protect Personal Data to ensure that it is kept private; however, we cannot guarantee the security of any Personal Data. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>

        <p>We maintain technical, physical, and administrative security measures to protect the security of your Personal Data against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls, data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls. We do not guarantee or warrant that such techniques will prevent unauthorized access to information about you that we store, Personal Data or otherwise.</p>

        <p>In addition, we limit access to your Personal Data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your Personal Data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>

        <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

        <h2 class="pt-4">HOW LONG WILL YOU USE MY PERSONAL DATA FOR?</h2>
        <p>We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or reporting requirements. We may retain your Personal Data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.</p>

        <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or other requirements.</p>

        <p>By law we have to keep basic information about our customers for ten years after they cease being customers.</p>

        <p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data; see your legal rights below for further information.</p>

        <ul class="has-bullets pl-4 pb-4">
          <li>Request access to your Personal Data (commonly known as “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
          <li>Request correction of the Personal Data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
          <li>Request erasure of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully, or where we are required to erase your Personal Data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
          <li>Object to processing of your Personal Data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party), and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>
          <li>Request restriction of processing of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Data in the following scenarios:</li>
          <li>If you want to establish the data’s accuracy;</li>
          <li>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;</li>
          <li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims;</li>
          <li>You have an objection to our use of your data but we need to verify whether you have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
          <li>Request the transfer of your Personal Data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
          <li>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
          <li>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact <a href="mailto:support@lumenshine.com">support@lumenshine.com</a> .</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>

        <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>

        <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
