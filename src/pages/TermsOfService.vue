            <ul class="has-bullets pl-4 pb-4">
              <li>Lumenshine is a user interface for the Stellar network. The Stellar network is hosted by numerous distributed nodes world-wide who are not under the control of any single entity or groups of entities. Lumenshine does not control the Stellar network.</li>

You are responsible for determining the legality of your transactions.</li>
              <li>From time to time, Lumenshine may receive reports or information that certain assets are fraudulent, deceptive, and/or manipulative, or are spamming the network.

            </ul>

            <h2 class="pt-4">6. Prohibited Jurisdictions</h2>
            <p>Lumenshine monitors the IP addresses of all inbound traffic to determine the originating location of any user, and accordingly will attempt to prevent access to Lumenshine by users where regulatory requirements restrict the Services.

For more information about XLM fees, please see <a href="https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/fees.html">https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/fees.html</a>.

              <li>the Services generally or the software or systems that make the Services available;</li>
              <li>unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data;</li>
              <li>your storage, handling, security, privacy, and use of your cryptocurrency keys, mnemonic and password;</li>
              <li>statements, conduct, or intervention of any third party on the Services;</li>
              <li>any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Services;</li>
              <li>any problems that may result from the use of Stellar technology or the Stellar network; or</li>
              <li>any other matter relating to the Services.</li>
              <li>You agree to accept all risk and liability associated with any of your interactions with Us or Our Services.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Us and (as applicable) our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, officers, directors, agents, and employees (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by the Indemnified Parties arising out of or relating to (1) an assertion that Your User-Generated Content or the use thereof, may infringe any copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights of any individual or entity, or are a misappropriation of any individual or entity's trade secret, or contain any libelous, defamatory, disparaging, pornographic, or obscene materials; (2) Your violation of any rights of a third party; (3) any breach by You of your obligations under these Terms; (4) Your unlawful and/or unauthorized use of, or activities in connection with the Services; (5) Your violation of any applicable Law; (6) Your access to, use of, or inability to use the Services; and (7) any negligent acts, omissions or willful misconduct by You. The foregoing indemnities shall survive expiration or termination of these Terms.</p>

            <p>TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY BREACH OF ANY TERM IN THE TERMS, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHER DEFAULT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF $10. THIS LIMITATION WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THESE TERMS IS DEEMED TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>

            <h2 class="pt-4">12. Your Password an mnemonic (backup secret)</h2>
            <p>You understand that if you activate fingerprint or face recognition on your mobile device for a Lumenshine app, your password will be saved by the app in a secure location on your device (such as for example in the Keychain on iOS devices). After successful fingerprint or face recognition (e.g. on Login), the app will load your password from your device to log you in automatically or to sign transactions for you. If you enable face or fingerprint recognition for your mobile Lumenshine app, we can not guarantee for the security of your password. It is protected by your device, not by us. You do this on your own risk.</p>

            <p>The Lumenshine Site and apps never send your password to our server. The app uses cryptographic methods to verify to the server that you have provided the correct password to be able to log you in. You can read more about this kind of authentication method here: <a href="https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0010.md">https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0010.md</a>.</p>

            <p>In the Setup process, the Lumenshine Site or App generates a mnemonic (backup secret) for you. You are responsible for noting the generated mnemonic and for keeping it in a save location. The Site and the app encrypts the mnemonic by using a derivate of your password and sends the encrypted mnemonic to the server. Your password is never sent to the server. Lumenshine's server stores the encrypted mnemonic internally. Lumenshine's server never has access to the decrypted version of the mnemonic. It can only be encrypted with your password wich is never sent to the server. If you don't know your mnemonic, and you forget your password, you will be permanently locked out of your account. We have no access to your assets and stellar accounts. We can not decrypt encrypted mnemonic without your password.</p>

            <h2 class="pt-4">13. Cancellation and Termination</h2>
            <h5 class="pt-3 pb-2">A. Account Cancellation</h5>
            <p>It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account. You can cancel your Account at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:support@lumenshine.com">support@lumenshine.com</a> and then following the specific instructions provided to you in Lumenshine's response.</p>

            <h5 class="pt-3 pb-2">B. Upon Cancellation</h5>
            <p>We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. However, barring legal requirements, We will delete your Account and Your Content upon termination of the Services by either party (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is cancelled.</p>

            <p>After termination of your Account, you still remain liable for all transactions made while the Account was open.</p>

            <h5 class="pt-3 pb-2">C. Lumenshine's Right to Terminate</h5>
            <p>Lumenshine reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Services for any reason, with or without notice, at any time. Lumenshine also reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>

            <h2 class="pt-4">14. Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</h2>
            <p><strong>THE BELOW TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU SHOULD READ THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE CLOSELY, BECAUSE IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHT TO SEEK JUDICIAL REMEDIES FOR ANY CLAIMS YOU MAY WISH TO ASSERT.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>YOU SHOULD TAKE FURTHER STEPS TO CONDUCT RESEARCH AND CONSULT WITH OTHERS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AN ATTORNEY REGARDING THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS.</strong></p>

            <h5 class="pt-3 pb-2">A. Governing Law of the Arbitration Clause</h5>
            <p>The governing law of this arbitration clause shall be the laws of Germany.</p>

            <h5 class="pt-3 pb-2">B. Binding Arbitration; No Group Arbitration; Class Action Waiver</h5>
            <p>Any and all disputes or controversies, whether of law or fact of any nature whatsoever, arising from or respecting your use of Services shall be decided by binding arbitration by a single arbitrator from the German Arbitration Institute ("DIS") in accordance with the rules and regulations of DIS.</p>

            <p>By acceding to these Terms, <strong>you waive your right to proceedings in court, and your right to assert any class action, class arbitration, or other class or representative claims on behalf of yourself and other persons</strong>.</p>

            <p>Pre-arbitration discovery shall be permitted at the request of either party under appropriate protection for proprietary and confidential business information. The arbitration shall take place in Munich (München), Germany.</p>

            <p>You will only be permitted to pursue claims against on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative action or proceeding. You will only be permitted to seek relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) on an individual basis.</p>

            <p>Before filing a demand for arbitration, a party must send the other party written notice identifying the matter in dispute and invoking the procedures in this paragraph. You agree to notify Lumenshine in writing of any dispute within sixty days of when it arises.</p>

            <p>Within fifteen (15) days after such written notice is given, one or more principals of each party shall meet at a mutually agreeable location, for the purpose of determining whether they can resolve the dispute themselves by written agreement. If the parties fail to resolve the dispute by written agreement within the fifteen (15) day period, the complaining party may then initiate the arbitration process by filing a demand with DIS or such other body as the parties may agree upon. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a party from seeking temporary equitable relief, from DIS or such other body as the parties may mutually agree upon, during the fifteen (15) day period if necessary to prevent irreparable harm.</p>

            <p>The parties shall endeavor, within ten (10) days following the arbitration filing, to select a mutually acceptable arbitrator from the DIS panel. In the event that they are unable to do so, a DIS administrator or presiding arbitrator will make such appointment. Either party may disqualify any individual arbitrator who is a present or past employee, owner, or consultant to the opposing party or a competing organization.</p>

            <p>Unless the parties agree, any arbitration proceedings will be conducted in the utmost secrecy and, in such case, all documents, testimony, and records shall be received, heard, and maintained by the arbitrators in secrecy under seal, available for inspection only by the parties, their respective attorneys, and their respective experts, consultants, or witnesses who shall agree, in advance and in writing, to receive all such information except for the purposes of the arbitration, until such information shall become generally known.</p>

            <p>The arbitrator shall be able to decree any and all relief of an equitable nature, including, but not limited to, such relief as a temporary restraining order, a temporary injunction, or a permanent injunction, and shall also be able to award damages, with or without an accounting and costs. The decree or judgment of an award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the Parties and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the Parties.</p>

            <p>Reasonable notice of the time and place of arbitration shall be given to persons other than the parties, if such notice is required by law, in which case such persons or their authorized representatives shall have the right to attend or participate in the arbitration hearing in such manner as the law shall require.</p>

            <h2 class="pt-4">15. Miscellaneous</h2>
